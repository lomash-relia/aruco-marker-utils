# aruco-marker-utils
A collection of Python tools and notebooks for working with ArUco markers — including marker generation, pose estimation, camera calibration, and real-world robotics applications.

This repository contains Python notebooks and scripts for working with ArUco markers using OpenCV.  
It includes utilities for:
- Generating ArUco markers (thanks to https://chev.me/arucogen/)
- Detecting and tracking markers in video streams
- Estimating pose for robotics and AR applications
- Using markers for camera calibration and robot localization

## 🧩 Requirements
Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install opencv-python numpy
